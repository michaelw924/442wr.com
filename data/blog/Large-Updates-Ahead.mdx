# Preface

So I have been planning this for a while, but I have finally gotten around to it. There are currently 3 main pages, `About Me`, `Portfolio`, and a `Resume`, in the works for the past 2 weeks, and I finally have sufficient progress to warrant a post and a push it up to production.

<br />

## What all is now here?

Currently, this push will make a few things occur, first and foremost, 2 new tabs will be immediately visible on the top nav bar, that being `About Me` and `Portfolio` which go over a bit of who I am and what I have done in a more summary form.

## What's left to do?

There are currently a few loose ends to clean up as this post goes live, such as
my resume not yet going live, however this is mostly because I wish to revamp it
before publishing it here, for the world to see it. Another thing I am trying to
get happen in the background is for the website to be the top result on google when
`Haadi Majeed` is searched. At the time of writing this, this website is the third result, which is a great improvement from what it has been in the past.

Another thing that is still in the works is the tail end of the portfolio page, I still want to add reflections on how my academic career have gone.
