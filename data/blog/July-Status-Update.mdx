As of late May I have started an internship at EMC Insurance and have been busy working there. I am, ironically enough, doing some web dev for them using the same structure. This is why I do not continue to do so here (that much web dev isn't fun). But I am also doing some API Development for them, which is more enjoyable in my opinion.

However, I do plan on returning to the website soon, most likely after the internship ends and I have sharpened my skills to make this site even better. As a secondary status update, I have built a new computer as well! Pictures will follow in another post soon, I still have to learn about how to upload those nicely!
