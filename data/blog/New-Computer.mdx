# A new PC! Stats!?

TL;DR

- Gigabyte LGA1200
- 32 GB Ram over 2 sticks
- 1 TB SSD and 4 TB HD
- NZXT H510 Elite
- GTX 1060

I'm currently in the market for a new GPU since my current one is pretty old, but at this time the market is unreasonably bad.

## Planning

As per expected, I knew going into the process that I would be needing a new graphics card at the end of it all, but my current one would suffice until I could get one. The process began with hopping in a call with some friends of mine to determine what would be over-kill and what would be higher end, but not beyond the budget I had set for myself. I had also come to the decision that I wanted some RGB, but not an excessive amount and to stick with a general black and white theme for it all physically. I used PC PartPicker's website to properly plan out what the system would have.

Another thing that was more of a quality of life thing was wanting bluetooth / wireless capabilities for the desktop. Bluetooth is really convenient because linking devices and controllers and other fun devices. I also wanted wireless networking in the event, in the future, I do not have immediate access to a hard-wire connection. It also makes it possible for wifi sniffing and also to host a connection from the desktop's current connection.
