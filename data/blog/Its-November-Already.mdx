# Working at John Deere has been fantastic so far!

The project I am working on is called See and Spray, you can read and watch more about it [here](https://www.deere.com/en/sprayers/see-spray-select/). The TL;DR is that its on Sprayers to find weeds in fields and only spray the chemical then instead of across the whole entire field like it has in the past. It is really cool stuff!

# Other Projects!

I have that server I have mentioned in the past finally setup and running! It's running TrueNAS Scale which is exactly what I want it to do, because now I have an environment that I can host dedicated VMs in addition to a NAS for my family to utilize and a VPN for when I want to RDP to my desktop when not at home! Eventually, I plan on moving this website over to the server as well, but in order to do that I would need to switch off my current ISP since they do not allow the outbound hosting of anything besides a VPN. I suppose I could do some routing to make it go up through AWS and use that static IP, but I think the ideal situation would be to only pay one source to host it all. There is a new ISP in my area that offers a static IP for a bit extra, and I am debating that. Anyways...

## Other-Other Projects

I have a few ideas of things I want to do, and I am also getting together with a group of friends from college to create something using drones and automated flight, but that is still very early in development. Additionally, I have another idea for an app and website duo while traveling abroad and have been talking with a good friend from Pakistan to maybe get that project up and going as well! 

## Website Update Too?

Yes website update too, I think I finally have figured out how to make a page to display what I am currently listening to on spotify on this website, now if that's a good idea or not is up for debate, however I have figured out how to do it.
