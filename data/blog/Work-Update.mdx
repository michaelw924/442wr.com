# Working at Deere has been a blast so far

Over the few weeks, I have finally begun my professional career at John Deere where I have been working on Sprayers, and more specifically, [See and Spray Select](https://www.deere.com/en/sprayers/see-spray-select/) which is using computer vision to find weeds in fallowed land and spray as needed instead of coating the entire field in herbicide. I've had the opportunity to modify the codebase and test it on Sprayers running the software and that moment when you see the code _you_ wrote in action, that is truly satisfying. Seeing it all occurring, and though the change may be small, it still activates and the results are visible is a great feeling.

I don't know if anyone actually reads these, so if you do, could ya click the email button at the bottom of the page and let me know, else I may just put a pin on these blog posts. Though, I'll probably do at least one more for the server I've recently set up at home...
