        <p>
            We use a Sensenich ground-adjustable propeller for this airplane.
            Deciding against using a constant-speed propeller for the purposes 
            of reduced maintenance and cost, the ground-adjustable propeller
            provides an awesome alternative to tuning the airplane's performance
            right where we want it.

            For the RV-10 build, we will likely be using
            a constant-speed propeller. One of the biggest downsides to not having
            a constant-speed propeller is being able to slow down as easily when
            coming in to land.
