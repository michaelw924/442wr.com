<p>This airplane is equipped with a Lycoming YIO-360-YIO-360-AIB. The engine is a 180 horsepower, fuel injected, four cylinder engine. Yes, this is more horsepower than Vans recommends for this airframe. However, we have had exactly zero issues with this power on the airplane, and it was absolutely worth going with more horsepower.</p>
