        <p>
            This airplane is equipped with a Lycoming YIO-360-YIO-360-AIB. 
            The engine is a 180 horsepower, fuel injected, four cylinder engine. 
            Yes, this is more horsepower than Vans recommends for this airframe. 
            However, we have had exactly zero issues with this power on the airplane, 
            and it was absolutely worth going with more horsepower.</p>

              We did have an issue with the engine that was originally sent to us. This ultimately 
              resulted in us needing to send the engine back to Lycoming. However, the team at Lycoming
              was extremely helpful with the issue and absolutely made right by their manufacturing error.
              They even gave us a custom paint job and chrome push-rods for the trouble. The pictures before
              show the engine with an entirely red paint scheme, while the pictures after show the engine 
              after it was returned to us from the factory. Even with this encountered issue, Lycoming will 
              certainly be our manufacturer of choice going forward.</p>
