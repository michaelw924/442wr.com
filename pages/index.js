              I've graduated from Iowa State Engineering with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering, and
              have taken the task of creating a website to learn how to properly
              do front end development. You can read more about the website in
              the blog section. Overall development of the site going along nicely,
              however as I continue to develop it, I have to stop and learn all
              about the new framework that I have switched to.
